                                                    especially to bring directly to your podcast feed.

                                                    this year by Integral Ad Science. We are at CES 2025. I'm James
                                                    Kotecki and I'm here with Eric Weisberg, Global Chief Creative
                                                    Officer, Havas Health Network. Thank you so much for joining us in

                                                    here. Been a long time fan of here, so it's good to finally meet
                                                    you.<br>James Kotecki (00:46):<br>I know. I'm a little nervous about
                                                    this interview. Hopefully you don't drop any bombs from my past. But
                                                    let's talk about the future specifically what's coming up next this
                                                    year in 2025. What does Havas Health Network, first of all, what
                                                    does it mean in 2025?<br>Eric Weisberg (00:58):<br>Well, I think,
                                                    look, we're living in an interesting time and health and I think
                                                    Covid was sort of an accelerator to our awareness of our own
                                                    personal health, the health of our families, the health of our
                                                    communities. And as a creative person, I look at this year as being
                                                    the year of creative convergence. So we live in a place where people
                                                    are having an ongoing argument, whether data is the new creativity
                                                    or culture is the new creativity or content is the new creativity.
                                                    And I think we're really witnessing a convergence of all of that.
                                                    You see it here on the floor.<br>James Kotecki (01:33):<br>So what's
                                                    your message here at CES 2025? I understand you just conducted a
                                                    tour of the health section of CES. You're obviously right in the
                                                    mix.<br>Eric Weisberg (01:40):<br>Yeah, I think, look, my message is
                                                    I think, sort of clear in what we're seeing, which is that every
                                                    brand today is a health brand. You see the biggest brands in the
                                                    world, Samsung, Apple, Google making an investment of health. And so
                                                    they're becoming health brands in their own right. And you see on
                                                    the floor there health brands with hospital level technology
                                                    becoming consumer brands. And so in a world like that, every brand
                                                    is a health brand and needs to put health first.<br>James Kotecki
                                                    (02:08):<br>That is a great term because we always used to hear
                                                    every company is a tech company, and I still think that's
                                                    true.<br>Eric Weisberg (02:13):<br>That's true.<br>James Kotecki
                                                    (02:14):<br>Every company is a media company and I still think
                                                    that's true. And now we're learning every company is a health
                                                    company. Companies have a lot on their plate, a lot of different
                                                    things that they have to be.<br>Eric Weisberg (02:22):<br>There is a
                                                    lot going on, but I mean, look, Tim Cook said that Apple's biggest
                                                    contribution to the world will be in health. That's something I
                                                    don't think we thought we would've heard 10 years ago.<br>James
                                                    Kotecki (02:32):<br>Yeah. Anything specific stand out to you on the
                                                    show floor that you want to call out? I know there's a lot to see
                                                    there.<br>Eric Weisberg (02:39):<br>There is a lot to see. I'll say
                                                    there was one thing that blew me away, which is this company,
                                                    Withings, has a mirror. You stand in front of it, it scans you, it
                                                    has all of your vitals. It uses AI, agentic AI to sort of interpret
                                                    that data and then help you make better decisions about your health.
                                                    To me, that's the future. It's a prototype, you can't go buy it
                                                    tomorrow, but holy cow.<br>James Kotecki (03:05):<br>I want to talk
                                                    about weight loss medications like Ozempic and there is a creative
                                                    strategy that companies need to have when selling this kind of stuff
                                                    and approaching the messaging around this kind of stuff. And I'm
                                                    curious what your thoughts are on that.<br>Eric Weisberg
                                                    (03:18):<br>I mean, look, I don't think any of us have seen a
                                                    blockbuster like this GLP-1 era ever in the world of health. It's
                                                    projected to be a $500 billion business. It is, if you believe,
                                                    which I do in the sort of Galloway prognostication, is that GLP-1
                                                    will be bigger than AI. And so we've launched a consultancy not to
                                                    help GLP-1 brands, but to help every brand have a GLP-1 strategy. It
                                                    affects what we eat, what we drink, where we travel, decisions that
                                                    we make about our mental health. It touches everything.<br>James
                                                    Kotecki (03:55):<br>Let's dive into some of those. So give us some
                                                    more of those kind of second order effects that other businesses
                                                    might need to be thinking about given the reality of these
                                                    drugs.<br>Eric Weisberg (04:03):<br>So they have an incredibly
                                                    positive impact, which is that you lose weight from them. What comes
                                                    from that are positive and negative effects of that. So if you're a
                                                    beauty brand, when you lose all that weight, it changes the
                                                    composition of your face. It changes the decisions you make about
                                                    what you do to look great. There are also side effects and we're
                                                    working with companies, whether that's gastrointestinal distress,
                                                    whether that's muscle loss that requires more protein. So it pretty
                                                    much touches everything in our lives and it will change how we
                                                    travel and vacation.<br>James Kotecki (04:40):<br>Yeah, tell me more
                                                    about that.<br>Eric Weisberg (04:41):<br>Well, you think about what
                                                    vacation has been, which has been letting go of your inhibitions,
                                                    indulgence in all-<br>James Kotecki (04:51):<br>That midnight buffet
                                                    on the cruise.<br>Eric Weisberg (04:53):<br>Exactly. Suddenly those
                                                    aren't interesting to you. You're not driven by those same things.
                                                    So it will change the makeup of a programming for Disney, for cruise
                                                    ships, for resorts.<br>James Kotecki (05:03):<br>Yes. Speaking of
                                                    health tech, I understand that you have an upcoming report, your
                                                    Superwomen report? Superwomen report, and you're looking at how
                                                    health tech has historically been designed for men. So what's the
                                                    opportunity for brands as women's health gets more focused-<br>Eric
                                                    Weisberg (05:20):<br>I mean, I'll throw a little statistic at you,
                                                    which is that 80% of health decisions in the family are made by
                                                    women. Yet in 2023, only 2% of investment by VCs in health tech were
                                                    for women. Crazy, right?<br>James Kotecki (05:37):<br>That's pretty
                                                    shocking, yes.<br>Eric Weisberg (05:39):<br>Only in spite of women
                                                    being 51% of the population, less than 30% are in clinical trials.
                                                    And we live in an era where medical gaslighting has been a reason
                                                    that women spend 25% of their lives in chronic pain or other
                                                    conditions at a significantly higher rate than men. And so when we
                                                    are looking at this creative convergence of what's happening in
                                                    health, we're seeing that there was a health equity gap with women
                                                    and we're seeing that shift finally happen. And so we put out this
                                                    trend report called Superwomen. It's a follow-up of a trend report
                                                    we did called Superhuman last year about technology and the
                                                    increasing impact on longevity. And so that was a big passion for us
                                                    this year.<br>James Kotecki (06:25):<br>We're living at a time, I
                                                    think when we're getting a lot of mixed signals about the future of
                                                    health and healthcare. We're at CES, we're extremely optimistic
                                                    about the future. We have all these great technologies. We have
                                                    these seemingly miraculous medications. We have hopefully a more
                                                    focus on women's health. And we also have huge political strife
                                                    around the healthcare system. It continues to be a political issue
                                                    here and elsewhere. How do you think about brands navigating this
                                                    kind of fraught moment where all these things are being held in
                                                    tension?<br>Eric Weisberg (06:50):<br>Yeah, I mean, look, I think
                                                    there's an interesting reality, which is that we have questionable
                                                    belief in our governments, in a lot of things in our lives, in our
                                                    news sources. Brands have an interesting opportunity to be the
                                                    trusted sources for information and help. And I think they're in an
                                                    interesting place to put inclusivity at the center of it. We talk
                                                    about closing these health equity gaps. Brands are really good
                                                    places and good things to be taking those things on. And that's what
                                                    we saw in Superhuman and then Superwomen this year.<br>James Kotecki
                                                    (07:29):<br>So then expanding that conversation on inclusivity to
                                                    DEI initiatives, diversity, equity, inclusion initiatives, we're
                                                    also at an era where maybe those are politically controversial and
                                                    companies may be thinking about backing away from that. Where do you
                                                    stand? Where does your business stand? And I was thinking also just
                                                    zooming out, is this kind of intuition that I have actually true?
                                                    Are brands kind backing away from this?<br>Eric Weisberg
                                                    (07:51):<br>I think there's a few things going on. I do think there
                                                    has been a backlash against purpose washing as opposed to purpose
                                                    doing. Are brands putting a patina of purpose on things or are they
                                                    actually doing things that make a difference? And I think health is
                                                    an example where when we talk about every brand being a health
                                                    brand, brands really have an opportunity and a responsibility to be
                                                    as inclusive as possible. Look, anybody that shrinks their
                                                    investment, mental investment or capital investment in D&amp;I or
                                                    inclusivity initiatives, they do so at their own peril. More
                                                    inclusive companies, more inclusive brands are more successful,
                                                    brands are more creative brands, are more innovative brands. It's
                                                    been proven all day every day. So I don't know, there may be brands
                                                    out there doing it. It certainly, I think they do so at their own
                                                    peril.<br>James Kotecki (08:46):<br>Are there other industry trends
                                                    that you want to highlight here at the beginning of the year that
                                                    you think people should pay more attention to?<br>Eric Weisberg
                                                    (08:51):<br>Well, I think we get into a lot of conversations at
                                                    events like this, where is it this or that? Is it AI or is it
                                                    creativity? Is it data or is it creativity? Is it media or is it
                                                    traditional marketing? I guess I've lost patience with the "or"
                                                    mentality. I think when I talk about creative convergence, that's an
                                                    "and" mentality. What is the right combination of things to build a
                                                    brand today? And I think to me, that I think is where the future is
                                                    going to be. I mean, 55% of the media we consume is not ad
                                                    supported. So advertising alone is obviously not the
                                                    solution.<br>James Kotecki (09:35):<br>So I love this idea of an
                                                    "and" mentality. And as we wrap up here, I'm wondering, is there a
                                                    technology or an industry maybe outside the direct health space, but
                                                    another technology maybe here or elsewhere that is inspiring to you
                                                    and you think could have interesting confluence with some of these
                                                    things that you're talking about?<br>Eric Weisberg (09:53):<br>I'm
                                                    going to go full nerd for a moment.<br>James Kotecki
                                                    (09:54):<br>Yes, please do. We're at CES.<br>Eric Weisberg
                                                    (09:57):<br>Which is I think the technology that I'm most excited
                                                    about are solid state batteries.<br>James Kotecki
                                                    (10:02):<br>Okay.<br>Eric Weisberg (10:03):<br>Crazy,
                                                    right?<br>James Kotecki (10:04):<br>Well, say a little bit more
                                                    about that.<br>Eric Weisberg (10:05):<br>So the biggest health issue
                                                    of our time is climate change. A huge opportunity to make a shift in
                                                    that. So climate change for... How does it impact your health? Much
                                                    higher rate of asthma and other respiratory disease, infects
                                                    cardiology, pests, mental health, heat exhaustion, all of these
                                                    things. What is the solution? The solution is a shift in our
                                                    consumption of energy. And solid state batteries are this massive
                                                    shift that go from cars and trucks with range anxiety and waiting a
                                                    half hour or an hour to charge them, to charging them in minutes to
                                                    going 650 miles on a charge. So there's a technology that we are on
                                                    the cusp of companies like Honda and Toyota and Hyundai solving, and
                                                    if they do it, it will change human health for the better.<br>James
                                                    Kotecki (10:59):<br>Well, thanks for connecting so many dots for us
